       "MANY YEARS LATER as he faced the firing squad. Colonel Aureliano Buendfa was to remember that \n",
       "distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. At that time Macondo was a village of \n",
       "twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished \n",
       "stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many \n",
       "things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point. Every year during the \n",
       "month of March a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tents near the village, and with a great \n",
       "uproar of pipes and kettledrums they would display new inventions. First they brought the magnet. \n",
       "A heavy gypsy with an untamed beard and sparrow hands, who introduced himself as Melquiades, \n",
       "put on a bold public demonstration of what he himself called the eighth wonder of the learned al¬ \n",
       "chemists of Macedonia. He went from house to house dragging two metal ingots and everybody was \n",
       "amazed to see pots, pans, tongs, and braziers tumble down from their places and beams creak from \n",
       "the desperation of nails and screws trying to emerge, and even objects that had been lost for a long \n",
       "time appeared from where they had been searched for most and went dragging along in turbulent \n",
       "confusion behind Melquiades’ magical irons. “Things have a life of their own,” the gypsy proclaimed \n",
       "with a harsh accent. “It’s simply a matter of waking up their souls.” Jose Arcadio Buendia, whose \n",
       "unbridled imagination always went beyond the genius of nature and even beyond miracles and \n",
       "magic, thought that it would be possible to make use of that useless invention to extract gold from \n",
       "the bowels of the earth. Melquiades, who was an honest man, warned him: “It won’t work for \n",
       "that.” But Jose Arcadio Buendia at that time did not believe in the honesty of gypsies, so he traded \n",
       "Iris mule and a pair of goats for the two magnetized ingots. Ursula Iguaran, his wife, who relied on \n",
       "those animals to increase their poor domestic holdings, was unable to dissuade him. “Very soon well \n",
       "have gold enough and more to pave the floors of the house,” her husband replied. For several \n",
       "months he worked hard to demonstrate the truth of his idea. He explored every inch of the region, \n",
       "even the riverbed, dragging the two iron ingots along and reciting Melquiades’ incantation aloud. \n",
       "The only thing he succeeded in doing was to unearth a suit of fifteenth-century armor which had all \n",
       "of its pieces soldered together with rust and inside of which there was the hollow resonance of an \n",
       "enormous stone-filled gourd. When Jose Arcadio Buendia and the four men of his expedition \n",
       "managed to take the armor apart, they found inside a calcified skeleton with a copper locket \n",
       "containing a woman’s hair around its neck. \n",
       "\n",
       "In March the gypsies returned. This time they brought a telescope and a magnifying glass the size \n",
       "of a dmm, which they exhibited as the latest discovery of the Jews of Amsterdam. They placed a \n",
       "gypsy woman at one end of the village and set up the telescope at the entrance to the tent. For the \n",
       "price of five reales, people could look into the telescope and see the gypsy woman an arm’s length \n",
       "away. “Science has eliminated distance,” Melquiades proclaimed. “In a short time, man will be able \n",
       "to see what is happening in any place in the world without leaving his own house.” A burning \n",
       "noonday sun brought out a startling demonstration with the gigantic magnifying glass: they put a pile \n",
       "of dry hay in the middle of the street and set it on fire by concentrating the sun’s rays. Jose Arcadio \n",
       "Buendfa, who had still not been consoled for the failure of big magnets, conceived the idea of using \n",
       "that invention as a weapon of war. Again Melquiades tried to dissuade him, but he finally accepted \n",
       "the two magnetized ingots and three colonial coins in exchange for the magnifying glass. Ursula \n",
       "wept in consternation. That money was from a chest of gold coins that her father had put together \n",
       "ova an entire life of privation and that she had buried underneath her bed in hopes of a proper \n",
       "occasion to make use of it. Jose Arcadio Buendfa made no at. tempt to console her, completely \n",

       "absorbed in his tactical experiments with the abnegation of a scientist and even at the risk of his own \n",
       "life. In an attempt to show the effects of the glass on enemy troops, he exposed himself to the \n",
       "concentration of the sun’s rays and suffered burns which turned into sores that took a long time to \n",
       "heal. Over the protests of his wife, who was alarmed at such a dangerous invention, at one point he \n",
       "was ready to set the house on fire. He would spend hours on end in his room, calculating the \n",
       "strategic possibilities of his novel weapon until he succeeded in putting together a manual of \n",
       "startling instructional clarity and an irresistible power of conviction. He sent it to the government, \n",
       "accompanied by numerous descriptions of his experiments and several pages of explanatory \n",
       "sketches; by a messenger who crossed the mountains, got lost in measureless swamps, forded stormy \n",
       "rivers, and was on the point of perishing under the lash of despair, plague, and wild beasts until he \n",
       "found a route that joined the one used by the mules that carried the mail. In spite of the fact that a \n",
       "trip to the capital was little less than impossible at that time, Jose Arcadio Buendia promised to \n",
       "undertake it as soon as the government ordered him to so that he could put on some practical \n",
       "demonstrations of his invention for the military authorities and could train them himself in the \n",
       "complicated art of solar war. For several years he waited for an answer. Finally, tired of waiting, he \n",
       "bemoaned to Melquiades the failure of Iris project and the gypsy then gave him a convincing proof \n",
       "of his honesty: he gave him back the doubloons in exchange for the magnifying glass, and he left \n",
       "him in addition some Portuguese maps and several instruments of navigation. In his own \n",
       "handwriting he set down a concise synthesis of the studies by Monk Hermann, which he left Jose \n",
       "Arcadio so that he would be able to make use of the astrolabe, the compass, and the sextant. Jose \n",
       "Arcadio Buendia spent the long months of the rainy season shut up in a small room that he had built \n",
       "in the rear of the house so that no one would disturb his experiments. Having completely aban¬ \n",
       "doned Iris domestic obligations, he spent entire nights in the courtyard watching the course of the \n",
       "stars and he almost contracted sunstroke from trying to establish an exact method to ascertain noon. \n",
       "When he became an expert in the use and manipulation of his instmments, he conceived a notion of \n",
       "space that allowed him to navigate across unknown seas, to visit uninhabited territories, and to \n",
       "establish relations with splendid beings without having to leave his study. That was the period in \n",
       "which he acquired the habit of talking to himself, of walking through the house without paying \n",
       "attention to anyone, as Ursula and the children broke their backs in the garden, growing banana and \n",
       "caladium, cassava and yams, ahuyama roots and eggplants. Suddenly, without warning, his feverish \n",
       "activity was intermpted and was replaced by a kind of fascination. He spent several days as if he \n",
       "were bewitched, softly repeating to himself a string of fearful conjectures without giving credit to his \n",
       "own understanding. Finally, one Tuesday in December, at lunchtime, all at once he released the \n",
       "whole weight of Iris torment. The children would remember for the rest of their lives the august \n",
       "solemnity with which their father, devastated by his prolonged vigil and by the wrath of Iris \n",
       "imagination, revealed his discovery to them: \n",
       "\n",
       "“The earth is round, like an orange.” \n",
       "\n",
       "Ursula lost her patience. “If you have to go crazy, please go crazy all by yourself!” she shouted. \n",
       "“But don’t try to put your gypsy ideas into the heads of the children.” Jose Arcadio Buendia, \n",
       "impassive, did not let himself be frightened by the desperation of his wife, who, in a seizure of rage, \n",
       "mashed the astrolabe against the floor. He built another one, he gathered the men of the village in \n",
       "Iris little room, and he demonstrated to them, with theories that none of them could understand, the \n",
       "possibility of returning to where one had set out by consistently sailing east. The whole village was \n",
       "convinced that Jose Arcadio Buendia had lost his reason, when Melquiades returned to set things \n",
       "straight. He gave public praise to the intelligence of a man who from pure astronomical speculation \n",
       "had evolved a theory that had already been proved in practice, although unknown in Macondo until \n",
       "then, and as a proof of his admiration he made him a gift that was to have a profound influence on \n",

       "By then Melquiades had aged with surprising rapidity. On his first trips he seemed to be the same \n",
       "age as Jose Arcadio Buendia. But while the latter had preserved his extraordinary strength, which \n",
       "permitted him to pull down a horse by grabbing its ears, the gypsy seemed to have been worn dowse \n",
       "by some tenacious illness. It was, in reality, the result of multiple and rare diseases contracted on his \n",
       "innumerable trips around the world. According to what he himself said as he spoke to Jose Arcadio \n",
       "Buendia while helping him set up the laboratory, death followed him everywhere, sniffing at the \n",
       "cuffs of his pants, but never deciding to give him the final clutch of its claws. He was a fugitive from \n",
       "all the plagues and catastrophes that had ever lashed mankind. He had survived pellagra in Persia, \n",
       "scurvy in the Malayan archipelago, leprosy in Alexandria, beriberi in Japan, bubonic plague in \n",
       "Madagascar, an earthquake in Sicily, and a disastrous shipwreck in the Strait of Magellan. That \n",
       "prodigious creature, said to possess the keys of Nostradamus, was a gloomy man, enveloped in a sad \n",
       "aura, with an Asiatic look that seemed to know what there was on the other side of tilings. He wore \n",
       "a large black hat that looked like a raven with widespread wings, and a velvet vest across which the \n",
       "patina of the centuries had skated. But in spite of his immense wisdom and his mysterious breadth, \n",
       "he had a human burden, an earthly condition that kept him involved in the small problems of daily \n",

       "economic difficulties, and he had stopped laughing a long time back because scurvy had made his \n",
       "teeth drop out. On that suffocating noontime when the gypsy revealed his secrets, Jose Arcadio \n",
       "Buendia had the certainty that it was the beginning of a great friendship. The children were startled \n",
       "by his fantastic stories. Aureliano, who could not have been more than five at the time, would \n",
       "remember him for the rest of his life as he saw him that afternoon, sitting against the metallic and \n",
       "quivering light from the window, lighting up with his deep organ voice the darkest reaches of the \n",
       "imagination, while down over his temples there flowed the grease that was being melted by the heat. \n",
       "Jose Arcadio, his older brother, would pass on that wonderful image as a hereditary memory to all of \n",
       "Iris descendants. Ursula on the other hand, held a bad memory of that visit, for she had entered the \n",
       "room just as Melquiades had carelessly broken a flask of bichloride of mercury. \n",
       "\n",
       "“It’s the smell of the devil,” she said. \n",
       "\n",
       "“Not at all,” Melquiades corrected her. “It has been proven that the devil has sulphuric properties \n",
       "and this is just a little corrosive sublimate.” \n",
       "\n",
       "Always didactic, he went into a learned exposition of the diabolical properties of cinnabar, but \n",
       "Ursula paid no attention to him, although she took the children off to pray. That biting odor would \n",
       "stay forever in her mind linked to the memory of Melquiades. \n",
       "\n",
       "The mdimentary laboratory—in addition to a profusion of pots, funnels, retorts, filters, and \n",
       "sieves—was made up of a primitive water pipe, a glass beaker with a long, thin neck, a reproduction \n",
       "of the philosopher’s egg, and a still the gypsies themselves had built in accordance with modern \n",
       "descriptions of the three-armed alembic of Mary the Jew. Along with those items, Melquiades left \n",
       "samples of the seven metals that corresponded to the seven planets, the formulas of Moses and \n",
       "Zosimus for doubling the quantity of gold, and a set of notes and sketches concerning the processes \n",
       "of the Great Teaching that would permit those who could interpret them to undertake the \n",
       "manufacture of the philosopher’s stone. Seduced by the simplicity of the formulas to double the \n",
       "quantity of gold, Jose Arcadio Buendia paid court to Ursula for several weeks so that she would let \n",
       "him dig up her colonial coins and increase them by as many times as it was possible to subdivide \n",
       "mercury. Ursula gave in, as always, to her husband’s unyielding obstinacy. Then Jose Arcadio \n",
       "Buendia threw three doubloons into a pan and fused them with copper filings, orpiment, brimstone, \n",
       "and lead. He put it all to boil in a pot of castor oil until he got a thick and pestilential syrup which \n",

       "When the gypsies came back, Ursula had turned the whole population of the village against them. \n",
       "But curiosity was greater than fear, for that time the gypsies went about the town making a \n",
       "deafening noise with all manner of musical instruments while a hawker announced the exhibition of \n",
       "the most fabulous discovery of the Naciancenes. So that everyone went to the tent and by paying \n",
       "one cent they saw a youthful Melquiades, recovered, unwrinkled, with a new and flashing set of \n",
       "teeth. Those who remembered his gums that had been destroyed by scurvy, his flaccid cheeks, and \n",
       "his withered lips trembled with fear at the final proof of the gypsy’s supernatural power. The fear \n",
       "turned into panic when Melquiades took out his teeth, intact, encased in their gums, and showed \n",
       "them to the audience for an instant—a fleeting instant in which he went back to being the same \n",
       "decrepit man of years past—and put them back again and smiled once more with the full control of \n",
       "his restored youth. Even Jose Arcadio Buendia himself considered that Melquiades’ knowledge had \n",
       "reached unbearable extremes, but he felt a healthy excitement when the gypsy explained to him \n",
       "atone the workings of his false teeth. It seemed so simple and so prodigious at the same time that \n",
       "overnight he lost all interest in his experiments in alchemy. He underwent a new crisis of bad \n",
       "humor. He did not go back to eating regularly, and he would spend the day walking through the \n",
       "house. “Incredible things are happening in the world,” he said to Ursula. “Right there across the \n",
       "river there are all kinds of magical instmments while we keep on living like donkeys.” Those who \n",
       "had known him since the foundation of Macondo were startled at how much he had changed under \n",
       "Melquiades’ influence. \n",
       "\n",
       "At first Jose Arcadio Buendia had been a kind of youthful patriarch who would give instructions \n",
       "for planting and advice for the raising of children and animals, and who collaborated with everyone, \n",
       "even in the physical work, for the welfare of the community. Since his house from the very first had \n",
       "been the best in the village, the others had been built in its image and likeness. It had a small, well- \n",
       "lighted living roost, a dining room in the shape of a terrace with gaily colored flowers, two \n",
       "bedrooms, a courtyard with a gigantic chestnut tree, a well kept garden, and a corral where goats, \n",
       "pigs, and hens lived in peaceful communion. The only animals that were prohibited, not just in his \n",
       "house but in the entire settlement, were fighting cocks. \n",
       "\n",
       "Ursula’s capacity for work was the same as that of her husband. Active, small, severe, that woman \n",
       "of unbreakable nerves who at no moment in her life had been heard to sing seemed to be \n",
       "everywhere, from dawn until quite late at night, always pursued by the soft whispering of her stiff, \n",
       "starched petticoats. Thanks to her the floors of tamped earth, the unwhitewashed mud walls, the \n",
       "rustic, wooden furniture they had built themselves were always dean, and the old chests where they \n",
       "kept their clothes exhaled the warm smell of basil. \n",
       "\n",
       "Jose Arcadio Buendia, who was the most enterprising man ever to be seen in the village, had set \n",
       "up the placement of the houses in such a way that from all of them one could reach the river and \n",
       "draw water with the same effort, and he had lined up the streets with such good sense that no house \n",
       "got more sun than another during the hot time of day. Within a few years Macondo was a village \n",
       "that was more orderly and hard working than any known until then by its three hundred inhabitants. \n",
       "It was a truly happy village where no one was over thirty years of age and where no one had died. \n",
       "\n",
       "Since the time of its founding, Jose Arcadio Buendia had built traps and cages. In a short time he \n",
       "filled not only his own house but all of those in the village with troupials, canaries, bee eaters, and \n",
       "redbreasts. The concert of so many different birds became so disturbing that Ursula would plug her \n",
       "ears with beeswax so as not to lose her sense of reality. The first time that Melquiades’ tribe arrived, \n",
       "selling glass balls for headaches, everyone was surprised that they had been able to find that village \n",
       "lost in the drowsiness of the swamp, and the gypsies confessed that they had found their way by the \n",

       "That spirit of social initiative disappeared in a short time, pulled away by the fever of the \n",
       "magnets, the astronomical calculations, the dreams of transmutation, and the urge to discover the \n",
       "wonders of the world. From a clean and active man, Jose Arcadio Buendia changed into a man lazy \n",
       "in appearance, careless in his dress, with a wild beard that Ursula managed to trim with great effort \n",
       "and a kitchen knife. There were many who considered him the victim of some strange spell. But \n",

       "contact with the great inventions. \n",
       "\n",
       "Jose Arcadio Buendia was completely ignorant of the geography of the region. He knew that to \n",
       "the east there lay an impenetrable mountain chain and that on the other side of the mountains there \n",
       "was the ardent city of Riohacha, where in times past—according to what he had been told by the \n",
       "first Aureliano Buendia, his grandfather—Sir Francis Drake had gone crocodile hunting with \n",
       "cannons and that he repaired hem and stuffed them with straw to bring to Queen Elizabeth. In his \n",
       "youth, Jose Arcadio Buendia and his men, with wives and children, animals and all kinds of domestic \n",
       "implements, had crossed the mountains in search of an outlet to the sea, and after twenty-six \n",
       "months they gave up the expedition and founded Macondo, so they would not have to go back. It \n",
       "was, therefore, a route that did not interest him, for it could lead only to the past. To the south lay \n",
       "the swamps, covered with an eternal vegetable scum and the whole vast universe of the great \n",
       "swamp, which, according to what the gypsies said, had no limits. The great swamp in the west \n",
       "mingled with a boundless extension of water where there were soft-skinned cetaceans that had the \n",
       "head and torso of a woman, causing the ruination of sailors with the charm of their extraordinary \n",
       "breasts. The gypsies sailed along that route for six months before they reached the strip of land over \n",
       "which the mules that carried the mail passed. According to Jose Arcadio Buendia’s calculations, the \n",
       "only possibility of contact with civilization lay along the northern route. So he handed out clearing \n",
       "tools and hunting weapons to the same men who had been with him during the founding of \n",
       "Macondo. He threw his directional instruments and his maps into a knapsack, and he undertook the \n",
       "reckless adventure. \n",
       "\n",
       "During the first days they did not come across any appreciable obstacle. They went down along \n",
       "the stony bank of the river to the place where years before they had found the soldier’s armor, and \n",
       "from there they went into the woods along a path between wild orange trees. At the end of the first \n",
       "week they killed and roasted a deer, but they agreed to eat only half of it and salt the rest for the days \n",
       "that lay ahead. With that precaution they tried to postpone the necessity of having to eat macaws, \n",
       "whose blue flesh had a harsh and musky taste. Then, for more than ten days, they did not see the \n",
       "sun again. The ground became soft and damp, like volcanic ash, and the vegetation was thicker and \n",
       "thicker, and the cries of the birds and the uproar of the monkeys became more and more remote, \n",
       "and the world became eternally sad. The men on the expedition felt overwhelmed by their most \n",
       "ancient memories in that paradise of dampness and silence, going back to before original sin, as their \n",
       "boots sank into pools of steaming oil and their machetes destroyed bloody lilies and golden salaman¬ \n",
       "ders. For a week, almost without speaking, they went ahead like sleepwalkers through a universe of \n",
       "grief, lighted only by the tenuous reflection of luminous insects, and their lungs were overwhelmed \n",
       "by a suffocating smell of blood. They could not return because the strip that they were opening as \n",
       "they went along would soon close up with a new vegetation that, almost seemed to grow before \n",

       "That night, during the frightful time of lying awake, he desired her again with a brutal anxiety, but he \n",

       "Days later the woman suddenly called him to her house, where she was alone with her mother, \n",

       "pushed it with the tips of his fingers and the hinges yielded with a mournful and articulate moan that \n",
       "left a frozen echo inside of him. From the moment he entered, sideways and trying not to make a \n",

       "making mysterious signals that did not correspond to their expressions. Catarino put a hand on his \n",

       "objects with an inexplicable fluidity, as if be were endowed with some instinct of direction based on \n",
       "an immediate prescience. One day he forgot to put in his false teeth, which at night he left in a glass \n",
       "of water beside his bed, and he never put them in again. When Ursula undertook the enlargement of \n",

       "understood something of what Melquiades was saying in his groping monologues, and he paid \n",

       "from his sleeve, extended his arms, and closed his eyes. Thereupon Father Nicanor rose six inches \n",
       "above the level of the ground. It was a convincing measure. He went among the houses for several \n",
       "days repeating the demonstration of levitation by means of chocolate while the acolyte collected so \n",

       "witness the revelation once more. He merely stretched on his stool a little and shrugged his \n",

       "who could not finish her lunch, Ursula celebrated Amaranta’s idea and contributed a considerable \n",

       "When Pietro Crespi found out about the new postponement, he went through a crisis of \n",
       "disappointment, but Rebeca gave him a final proof of her loyalty. “We’ll elope whenever you say,” \n",

       "of his fiancee and he considered respect for one’s given word as a wealth that should not be \n",
       "squandered. Then Rebeca turned to more audacious methods. A mysterious wind blew out the \n",

       "confused explanations about the poor quality of modern pitch lamps and he even helped her install a \n",
       "more secure system of illumination for the room. But the fuel failed again or the wicks became \n",
       "clogged and Ursula found Rebeca sitting on her fiance’s lap. This time she would accept no \n",
       "explanation. She turned the responsibility of the bakery over to the Indian woman and sat in a \n",
       "rocking chair to watch over the young people during the visits, ready to win out over maneuvers that \n",

       "seeing Ursula yawn during the boredom of the visits. “When she dies she’ll go off to her reward in \n",
       "that rocking chair.” After three months of supervised love, fatigued by the slow progress of the \n",
       "construction, which he went to inspect every day, Pietro Crespi decided to give Father Nicanor the \n",
       "money he needed to finish the church. Amaranta did not grow impatient. As she conversed with her \n",
       "girl friends every afternoon when they came to embroider on the porch, she tried to think of new \n",

       "him. Arcadio ordered them to give him a weapon and twenty cartridges, and he left him with five \n",
       "men to defend headquarters while he went off with his staff to head up the resistance. He did not \n",

       "rebellion, Colonel Aureliano Buendia fell prisoner just as he was about to reach the western frontier \n",

       "Colonel Gerineldo Marquez. The news of his capture was announced in Macondo with a special \n",

       "from somewhere that was not supported by any proclamation gave dramatic confirmation to the \n",

       "a cornet one second before Ursula burst into the room with the shout: “They’re bringing him now!” \n",
       "The troop struggled to subdue the overflowing crowd with their rifle butts. Ursula and Amaranta \n",
       "ran to the corner, pushing their way through, and then they saw him. He looked like a beggar. His \n",
       "clothing was torn, his hair and beard were tangled, and he was barefoot. He was walking without \n",
       "feeling the burning dust, his hands tied behind his back with a rope that a mounted officer had \n",
       "attached to the head of his horse. Along with him, also ragged and defeated, they were bringing \n",
       "Colonel Gerineldo Marquez. They were not sad. They seemed more disturbed by the crowd that was \n",
       "shouting all lands of insults at the troops. \n",
       "\n",
       "“My son!” Ursula shouted in the midst of the uproar, and she slapped the soldier who tried to \n",

       "avoided the arms of his mother, and fixed a stern look on her eyes. \n",
       "\n",
       "“Go home, Mama,” he said. “Get permission from the authorities to come see me in jail.” \n",

       "asked her, “What happened to your hand?” Amaranta raised the hand with the black bandage. “A \n",
       "burn,” she said, and took Ursula away so that the horses would not run her down. The troop took \n",
       "off. A special guard surrounded the prisoners and took them to the jail at a trot. \n",
       "\n",
       "At dusk Ursula visited Colonel Aureliano Buendia in jail. She had tried to get permission through \n",
       "Don Apolinar Moscote, but he had lost all authority in the face of the military omnipotence. Father \n",
       "Nicanor was in bed with hepatic fever. The parents of Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, who had not \n",
       "been condemned to death, had tried to see him and were driven off with rifle butts. Facing the \n",
       "impossibility of finding anyone to intervene, convinced that her son would be shot at dawn, Ursula \n",
       "wrapped up the tilings she wanted to bring him and went to the jail alone. \n",

       "\n",
       "“As you say, mister•” she accepted, “just as long as I can see him.” \n",

       "There were superior orders that prohibited visits to prisoners condemned to death, but the \n",

       "his arms spread out because his armpits were paved with sores. They had allowed him to shave. The \n",
       "thick mustache with twisted ends accentuated the sharp angles of his cheekbones. He looked paler \n",
       "to Ursula than when he had left, a little taller, and more solitary than ever. He knew all about the \n",
       "details of the house: Pietro Crespi’s suicide, Arcadio’s arbitrary acts and execution, the dauntlessness \n",
       "of Jose Arcadio Buendia underneath the chestnut tree. He knew that Amaranta had consecrated her \n",
       "virginal widowhood to the rearing of Aureliano Jose and that the latter was beginning to show signs \n",
       "of quite good judgment and that he had learned to read and write at the same time he had learned to \n",
       "speak. From the moment In which she entered the room Ursula felt inhibited by the maturity of her \n",
       "son, by his aura of command, by the glow of authority that radiated from his skin. She was surprised \n",
       "that he was so well-informed. “You knew all along that I was a wizard,” he joked. And he added in a \n",
       "serious tone, “This morning, when they brought me here, I had the impression that I had already \n",
       "been through all that before.” In fact, while the crowd was roaring alongside him, he had been \n",
       "concentrating his thoughts, startled at how the town had aged. The leaves of the almond trees were \n",
       "broken. The houses, painted blue, then painted red, had ended up with an indefinable coloration. \n",
       "\n",
       "“What did you expect?” Ursula sighed. “Time passes.” \n",
       "\n",
       "“That’s how it goes,” Aureliano admitted, “but not so much.” \n",
       "\n",
       "In that way the long-awaited visit, for which both had prepared questions and had even \n",
       "anticipated answers, was once more the usual everyday conversation. When the guard announced \n",
       "the end of the visit, Aureliano took out a roll of sweaty papers from under the cot. They were his \n",
       "poetry, the poems inspired by Remedios, which he had taken with him when he left, and those he \n",
       "had written later on during chance pauses in the war. “Promise me that no one will read them,” he \n",
       "said. “Light the oven with them this very night.” Ursula promised and stood up to kiss him good¬ \n",
       "bye. \n",
       "\n",
       "“I brought you a revolver,” she murmured. \n",
       "\n",
       "Colonel Aureliano Buendia saw that the sentry could not see. “It won’t do me any good,” he said \n",
       "in a low voice, “but give it to me in case they search you on the way out.” Ursula took the revolver \n",
       "out of her bodice and put it under the mattress of the cot. “And don’t say good-bye,” he concluded \n",
       "with emphatic calmness. “Don’t beg or bow down to anyone. Pretend that they shot me a long time \n",
       "ago.” Ursula bit her lip so as not to cry. \n",
       "\n",
       "“Put some hot stones on those sores,” she said. \n",

       "She turned halfway around and left the room. Colonel Aureliano Buendia remained standing, \n",

       "of adolescence, when he had begun to be aware of his premonitions, he thought that death would be \n",
       "announced with a definite, unequivocal, irrevocable signal, but there were only a few hours left \n",
       "before he would die and the signal had not come. On a certain occasion a very beautiful woman had \n",
       "come into his camp in Tucurinca and asked the sentries’ permission to see him. They let her through \n",
       "because they were aware of the fanaticism of mothers, who sent their daughters to the bedrooms of \n",
       "the most famous warriors, according to what they said, to improve the breed. That night Colonel \n",

       "\n",
       "When he turned around holding his Pistol, the girl had lowered hers and did not know what to \n",

       "close friend Colonel Magnifico Visbal, to whom he had given his cot so that he could sweat out a \n",
       "fever. A few yards away, sleeping in a hammock in the same room, he was not aware of anything. \n",
       "His efforts to systematize his premonitions were useless. They would come suddenly in a wave of \n",
       "supernatural lucidity, like an absolute and momentaneous conviction, but they could not be grasped. \n",
       "On occasion they were so natural that he identified them as premonitions only after they had been \n",
       "fulfilled. Frequently they were nothing but ordinary bits of superstition. But when they condemned \n",
       "him to death and asked him to state his last wish, he did not have the least difficulty in identifying \n",
       "the premonition that inspired his answer. \n",
       "\n",
       "“I ask that the sentence be carried out in Macondo,” he said. \n",

       "great deal of thinking he came to the conclusion that perhaps death would not be announced that \n",
       "time because it did not depend on chance but on the will of his executioners. He spent the night \n",
       "awake, tormented by the pain of his sores. A little before dawn he heard steps in the hallway. \n",
       "“They’re coming,” he said to himself, and for no reason he thought of Jose Arcadio Buendia, who at \n",
       "that moment was thinking about him under the dreary dawn of the chestnut tree. He did not feel \n",
       "fear or nostalgia, but an intestinal rage at the idea that this artificial death would not let him see the \n",
       "end of so many things that he had left unfinished. The door opened and a sentry came in with a mug \n",
       "of coffee. On the following day at the same hour he would still be doing what he was then, raging \n",
       "with the pain in his armpits, and the same thing happened. On Thursday he shared the sweet milk \n",
       "candy with the guards and put on his clean clothes, which were tight for him, and the patent leather \n",
       "boots. By Friday they had still not shot him. \n",
       "\n",
       "Actually, they did not dare carry out the sentence. The rebelliousness of the town made the \n",
       "military men think that the execution of Colonel Aureliano Buendia might have serious political \n",
       "consequences not only in Macondo but throughout the area of the swamp, so they consulted the \n",
       "authorities in the capital of the province. On Saturday night, while they were waiting for an answer \n",
       "Captain Roque Carnicero went with some other officers to Catarino’s place. Only one woman, \n",

       "“They won’t shoot him here,” Jose Arcadio, told her. “They’ll shoot him at midnight in the barracks \n",
       "so that no one will know who made up the squad, and they’ll bury him right there.” Rebeca kept on \n",
       "waiting. “They’re stupid enough to shoot him here,” she said. She was so certain that she had \n",
       "foreseen the way she would open the door to wave good-bye. “They won’t bring him through the \n",
       "streets,” Jose Arcadio insisted, with six scared soldiers and knowing that the people are ready for \n",
       "anything.” Indifferent to her husband’s logic, Rebeca stayed by the window. \n",
       "\n",
       "“You’ll see that they’re just stupid enough,” she said. \n",
       "\n",
       "On Tuesday, at five-in the. morning, Jose Arcadio had drunk his coffee and let the dogs out \n",
       "when Rebeca closed the window and held onto the head of the bed so as not to fall down. “There, \n",
       "they’re bringing him,” she sighed. “He’s so handsome.” Jose Arcadio looked out the window and \n",
       "saw him. tremulous in the light of dawn. He already had his back to the wall and his hands were on \n",
       "his hips because the burning knots in his armpits would not let him lower them. “A person fucks \n",
       "himself up so much,” Colonel Aureliano Buendia said. “Fucks himself up so much just so that six \n",
       "weak fairies can kill him and he can’t do anything about it.” He repeated it with so much rage that it \n",
       "almost seemed to be fervor, and Captain Roque Carnicero was touched, because he thought he was \n",
       "praying. When the squad took aim, the rage had materialized into a viscous and bitter substance that \n",
       "put his tongue to sleep and made him close his eyes. Then the aluminum glow of dawn disappeared \n",
       "and he saw himself again in short pants, wearing a tie around his neck, and he saw his father leading \n",
       "him into the tent on a splendid afternoon, and he saw the ice. When he heard the shout he thought \n",
       "that it was the final command to the squad. He opened his eyes with a shudder of curiosity, \n",

       "and with three mistresses, whom he installed in the same house, where he spent most of his time \n",
       "lying in a hammock. He scarcely read the telegraphic dispatches that reported routine operations. \n",
       "On one occasion Colonel Gerineldo Marquez asked him for instructions for the evacuation of a \n",

       "“Don’t bother me with trifles,” he ordered him. “Consult Divine Providence.” \n",

       "It was perhaps the most critical moment of the war. The Liberal landowners, who had supported \n",

       "to stop the revision of property titles. The politicians who supplied funds for the war from exile had \n",
       "Publicly repudiated the drastic aims of Colonel Aureliano Buendia, but even that withdrawal of \n",
       "authorization did not seem to bother him. He had not returned to reading his poetry, which filled \n",
       "more than five volumes and lay forgotten at the bottom of Inis trunk. At night or at siesta time he \n",
       "would call one of his women to his hammock and obtain a rudimentary satisfaction from her, and \n",
       "then he would sleep like a stone that was not concerned by the slightest indication of worry. Only he \n",
       "knew at that time that his confused heart was condemned to uncertainty forever. At first, intoxicated \n",
       "by the glory of his return, by his remarkable victories, he had peeped into the abyss of greatness. He \n",
       "took pleasure in keeping by his right hand the Duke of Marlborough, his great teacher in the art of \n",
       "war, whose attire of skins and tiger claws aroused the respect of adults and the awe of children. It \n",
       "was then that he decided that no human being, not even Ursula, could come closer to him than ten \n",
       "feet. In the center of the chalk circle that his aides would draw wherever he stopped, and which only \n",
       "he could enter, he would decide with brief orders that had no appeal the fate of the world. The first \n",
       "time that he was in Manaure after the shooting of General Moncada, he hastened to fulfill his \n",

       "Indian, untamed, illiterate, and endowed with quiet wiles and a messianic vocation that aroused a \n",
       "demented fanaticism in his men. Colonel Aureliano Buendia called the meeting with the aim of \n",

       "forward with his intentions: in a few hours he shattered the coalition of better-qualified commanders \n",

       "out even before they were given, even before he thought of them, and they always went much \n",
       "beyond what he would have dared have them do. Lost in the solitude of his immense power, he \n",
       "began to lose direction. He was bothered by the people who cheered him in neighboring villages, \n",

       "officers were lying to him. He fought with the Duke of Marlborough. “The best friend a person \n",
       "has,” he would say at that time, “is one who has just died.” He was weary of the uncertainty, of the \n",
       "vicious circle of that eternal war that always found him in the same place, but always older, wearier, \n",
       "even more in the position of not knowing why, or how, or even when. There was always someone \n",
       "outside of the chalk circle. Someone who needed money, someone who had a son with whooping \n",
       "cough, or someone who wanted to go off and sleep forever because he could not stand the shit taste \n",
       "of the war in his mouth and who, nevertheless, stood at attention to inform him: “Everything \n",
       "normal, colonel.” And normality was precisely the most fearful part of that infinite war: nothing ever \n",
       "happened. Alone, abandoned by his premonitions, fleeing the chill that was to accompany him until \n",
       "death, he sought a last refuge in Macondo in the warmth of his oldest memories. His indolence was \n",
       "so serious that when they announced the arrival of a commission from his party that was authorized \n",

       "the premonition that a pot of boiling soup was going to fall off the table, and he found her broken \n",
       "to pieces. In an instant he discovered the scratches, the welts, the sores, the ulcers, and the scan that \n",
       "had been left on her by more than half a century of daily life, and he saw that those damages did not \n",
       "even arouse a feeling of pity in him. Then he made one last effort to search in his heart for the place \n",
       "where his affection had rotted away and he could not find it. On another occasion, he felt at least a \n",
       "confused sense of shame when he found the smell of Ursula on his own skin, and more than once \n",
       "he felt her thoughts interfering with his. But all of that had been wiped out by the war. Even \n",
       "Remedios, his wife, at that moment was a hazy image of someone who might have been his daugh¬ \n",

       "was so recent that several weeks later, when Ursula went into the room with a pail of water and a \n",
       "brush to wash the floor, there was nothing for her to do. Aureliano Segundo was deep in the reading \n",

       "that had been melted by the heat, just as Aureliano and Jose Arcadio had seen him when they were \n",

       "manuscripts. “No one must know their meaning until he has reached one hundred years of age,” he \n",

       "workshop again, seduced at last by the peaceful charms of old age, Aureliano Segundo thought that \n",
       "it would be good business to devote himself to the manufacture of little gold fishes. He spent many \n",

       "opened the door and saw the courtyard paved with rabbits, blue in the glow of dawn. Petra Cotes, \n",

       "capable of tolerating even for a day a negligence that was beyond all understanding. The birth of the \n",
